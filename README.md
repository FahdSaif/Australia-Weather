Thankyou</br>

Checked for internet connection the fired the Almofire request to get JSON. If no internet connection is avalable then user will get the appropriate message. Once the data is fetched in the model object thre onwards even if internet disconnects the app runs smoothly.<br>

Developed and tested using Iphone-7. Autolayouting refinement has to be done more on this.<br>

Thankyou<br>
Happy Coding!<br>
